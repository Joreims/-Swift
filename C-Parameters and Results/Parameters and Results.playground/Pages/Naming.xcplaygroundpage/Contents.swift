/*:
 This function passes the side effect test and the function-as-a-sentence test.

 - Experiment: Think of some more tasks a program might perform. Write them out as sentences, then think about how those sentences would look as functions.\
 For example: “Get the first letter of ‘Swift’” would be `getTheFirstLetter(of: "Swift")`

 But this new function has another problem. Learn what it is and how to fix it.
